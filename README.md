## Description 

- This is a secure password generator that is easy to use to generate a secure password between 8 and 128 characters. 
- It is customizable and can choose between upper case letter, lower case letter, numbers and special characters.  
- The secure password generator is secure because it randomly selects from the user's input and requires at least 8 characters which is proven to strengthen passwords.
- It taught me a lot about if and for loops that I used to create and return the string of random characters.
